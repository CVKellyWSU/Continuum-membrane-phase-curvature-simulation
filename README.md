# Continuum-membrane-phase-curvature-simulation
Continuum membrane phase-curvature simulation shown in Woodward et al.

This Python code was written in Anaconda for with Python 3.9.12 64-bit | Qt 5.12.9 | PyQt5 5.12.3 | Windows 10.

The main code found in "Membrane phase curvature continuum simulation - Woodward.py" loads the membrane shape from the files "membrane_shape.npz" and "Curvature vs Z.dat." The output includes both a picture representation of the phase distribution across the membrane as well as an .npz file containing the simulation results.
